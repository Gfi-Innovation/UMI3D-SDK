# UMI3D-SDK
UMI3D is a web protocol that enables the creation of 3D media in which users of any AR/VR device can collaborate in real time. The 3D media is created once and hosted on a server or on a local computer. Any AR/VR device can display and interact with it remotely thanks to a dedicated UMI3D browser.
